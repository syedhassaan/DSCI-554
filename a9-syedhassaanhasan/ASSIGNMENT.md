# INF 554 Assignment 9

## Description

The goal for this assignment is to create statistical graphics in R and Python notebooks

- Use [UN Data](https://data.un.org/) of your choice and [Johns
        Hopkins University COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv) for the same 10 countries of `a1`
- Implement statistical graphics in R in `a10.Rmd` including:
        - steam-and-leaf-plot with R
        - ggplot2 scatterplot, bar chart, histogram, frequency polygon, smoothed density estimates, boxplot, violin plot and line chart
        - one ggplot2 trellis plot (wrapped facet), e.g., using `facet_wrap`
- Implement statistical graphics in Python in `a10.ipynb` including:
        - altair scatterplot, bar chart, histogram, boxplot, line chart and a map
        - one altair trellis plot (wrapped facet), e.g., using `alt.Facet`
        - any one plot for each of matplotlib, pandas and seaborne
- Use Markdown to document the notebooks

## Rubric

__15% of the grade is for the lab.__

For each notebook:

| Quality       | Points | Description |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Sophisticated | 4-5    | Notebook rendering in GitHub includes all the charts required and the charts are well formed. |
| Competent     | 2-3    | Notebook rendering in GitHub does not include all the charts required and/or the charts are not well formed. |
| Needs work    | 0-1    | Notebook rendering in GitHub are not present, or do not include all the charts required. |

## Homework Guidelines

- Homework repository must be updated before the deadline
- Commits after the deadline will not be considered unless requested
- Late policy: 10% of total available points per each late day; duration less than 24 hours counts as one whole day
