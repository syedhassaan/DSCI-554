# 🏋 ex1 R steam-and-leaf plot

Base R `stem {graphics}` is used to realize steam-and-leaf plots.

Read the docs with `?stem`

```{r}
?stem
```

## Example 1: plot a vector

```{r}
data = c(1, 3, 5, 10, 17, 17)
stem(data)
```

## Example 2: plot areas of the World's major landmasses

```{r}
?islands  #A named vector of length 48.
names(islands)
```

We can use [log: Logarithms and Exponentials](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/log) to resize the data.
```{r}
islands
islands[1]  #index starts at 1!
log10(islands[1])
```

```{r}
stem(islands)
stem(log10(islands))
```

Using `scale` to control the depth of the plot (see the documentation):

```{r}
stem(islands, 1)
stem(islands, 2)
stem(islands, 0.5)
stem(islands, 0.25)
```

# Exercises

## 😜 Exercise 1

Use `stem` to create a stem-and-leaf plot of the `chol` variable for the data in `heart-decease.cleveland.csv`

```{r}
df <- read.csv('data/heart-decease-cleveland.csv')
head(df)
stem(df$chol)

```
