# DSCI 554 Assignment 9

The lab contains R notebooks (`.Rmd` files) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks (`.ipynb` files).

Use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) to open  `R9.Rproj` (RStudio project file). You can start RStudio in the current folder from the command line with:

```bash
open -a RStudio a9.Rproj
```

Use [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/)  to run the Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files). You can start JupyterLab in the current folder from the command line with:

```bash
jupyter-lab
```

## Working with Notebooks
