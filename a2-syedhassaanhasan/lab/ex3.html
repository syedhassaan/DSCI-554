  <h1>üèãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ex3: hoisting</h1>

  <p>Rewrite the sample code hoisting the declarations (for variables and functions!), fix the errors, update the Answer with the source code.</p>

var b;  //var used on top of script (global scope) has no effect

//b = 3 now as b is in global scope
//what if f declares b?
