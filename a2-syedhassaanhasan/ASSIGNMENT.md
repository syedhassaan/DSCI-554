# DSCI 554 Assignment 2

## Description

- Use UN Data of your choice for the same 10 countries of `a1` to create 4 charts referred to as `Inkscape SVG`, `SVG Code`, `Dynamic SVG` and `Google Charts line chart`.
- Add explanations for the datasets and provenance for all the charts in `index.html`.
- You can borrow code and files from the lab for all the charts but create your own copies.
- Optionally you can separate your code in files, e.g., `index.html`, `style.css` and `chart.js`.
- Use sound development techniques: develop one feature at the time, test and commit often.
- It is expected that the page works well when tested with the node.js development environment provided.
- Format and document your code as needed for others to understand.

### Chart Requirements

#### Inkscape SVG Chart

- This is a design template in Inkscape: make sure to use pixels coordinates.
- Create a __bubble cloud__ with [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org) and show it in `index.html` using the `<img>` tag.

#### SVG Code Chart

- Using `Inkscape SVG` as a design template, create a __bubble cloud__ chart in using SVG code in `index.html`.
- Use SVG `circle` and `text` elements to draw and for the attributes use values from `Inkscape SVG`.

#### Dynamic SVG Chart

- Using `SVG Code`, re-create the same __bubble cloud__ in `index.html` programmatically in vanilla javascript (i.e., using drawing functions in javascript you write and not using third party libraries).
- Describe your data and charts as needed in the page.

#### Google Charts line chart

- Create a Google Charts line chart and add it to `index.html`.
- You can use a different dataset for this chart as long as you use the same 10 countries of `a1`.

## Rubric

__15% of the grade is for artifacts generated and committed in class as requested by the instructor.__

|               | Development   | Inkscape SVG | SVG code, Dynamic SVG, Google Charts line chart |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Sophisticated | Demonstrated use of node.js and sound Web development techniques, well documented (4-5 pts)| Design is well thought showing relations and quantities (4-5 pts)| Code is cleanly written and working, charts are according to design (4-5 pts each) |
| Competent     | Not using or not demonstrated use of node.js and Web development techniques, poorly documented, shows some proficiency in using git (2-3 pts) | Design is not well thought and/or not showing relations and quantities (2-3 pts)| Code not cleanly written and/or working, charts are not according to design (2-3 pts each)|
| Needs work    | Not using and not demonstrated use of node.js and Web development techniques, poorly or not documented, not using git appropriately (0-1 pts)| Design is not thought and not showing relations and quantities (0-1 pts)| Code is not cleanly written and not working, charts are not according to design (0-1 pts each)|

## Homework Guidelines

- Homework repository must be updated before the deadline
- Commits after the deadline will not be considered unless requested
- Late policy: 10% of total available points per each late day; duration less than 24 hours counts as one whole day
- Homework is expected to work in CHROME
