## Description

- Use README.md to document your work
- For 10 countries select [UN data](http://data.un.org) of your choice containing data over time
- __Create a Google Sheet document using your USC account__ then share it so that _Anyone at University of Southern California_ has access
- Import the data in Google Sheets and format the data to create a [line chart](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/63728)
- In `index.html` explain the dataset you want to graph and it's provenance
- In `index.html` add a link to the Google Sheet file
- Add the chart you created in Google Sheet to `index.html`:

- Inspect `index.html` in Chrome to make sure that:

    1. There are no errors
    2. The page is well formatted
    3. All the information needed to understand the data and the chart is included and well presented

- Commit your changes often after you test individual steps and remember to push!
