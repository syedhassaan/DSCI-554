# DSCI 554 Assignment 5

## Description

Adapt Assignment 4 to realize D3 charts with axes, axes labels, tick marks, tick mark labels and title.

- Upgrade your minimalistic designs to include axes, axes labels, tick marks, tick mark labels and title.
- __Use the margin convention for all charts__
- __Use D3 axes and D3 scales for all charts__.
- You can use the same or different data than for Assignment 4.
- 1D bubble charts are ok as long as you create an axis, tick marks, tick mark labels and title.

## Homework Guidelines

- Homework repository must be updated before the deadline
- Commits after the deadline will not be considered unless requested
- Late policy: 10% of total available points per each late day; duration less than 24 hours counts as one whole day
- Homework is expected to work in CHROME

## Important Note from Graders

__Ensure that you use the same case when referring to files than the actual filename__ as the homework may be assessed on Linux systems. For example, if an image tag refers to `myFile.png` but the actual filename is `myfile.png`, the image will not appear on the web page in Linux systems. We will deduct points if this happens. Use [Visual Studio Code HTML path completion feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_21#_html-path-completion) and/or double-check filenames to avoid this problem.
