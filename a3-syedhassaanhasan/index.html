            <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Pros</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple visualizations used, like donut charts and bar graphs. Most people would be able to interpret at a glance</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Cons</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Misleading title. Should read "American population interest in healthy foods", rather than "Vast Majority..." as the readers should make this decision themselves looking at the data visualization(particularly as a lot of the numbers are near to the middle i.e 50%, so it is not correct to say "Vast Mahority..") </li>
                <li>Total number of each population group not mentioned, meaning data set could be biased</li>
                <li>The drawing of the healthy foods (carrot, tomatoes etc) feels a bit out of place</li>
                <li>The first donut chart and bar chart are displaying almost the same information (redundant)</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Improvements</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fix the title</li>
                <li>Remove the drawings of the healthy foods (carrot, tomatoes etc)</li>
                <li>Need to add some historical data, so we can see whether Americans are headed in the right direction or not</li>
                <li>Legend for both the donut charts only needs to be displayed once, drawing it next to both charts is redundant</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Pros</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Motivating and catchy title</li>
                <li>Simple visualizations, quite easy to interpret overall</li>
                <li>The visualization is showing the benifits ("What's the return on our investment" section) to push the readers towards the better (healthier) choice</li>
                <li>The visualization depicted by the plates (top right section) is quite good and relevant, as the visualization is discussing about food primarily </li>
                <li>Has historical data of last few years, so readers can see the dietary trends</li>
                <li>Has presented overall data, as well as broken down by age group</li>
                <li>The visual information is summarized by a number displayed in the center of the visualization, "The Healthy Eating Index Score"</li>
                <li>Even though a lot of data is presented in the visualization, it is presented quite concisely and does not overwhelm the reader, due to the appropriate and simple visualizations used</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Cons</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The 3 paragraphs at the bottom, don't go along with the overall theme of the visualization. As the visualization is mostly using charts to depict information but at the bottom there is a huge blob of words</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Improvements</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the 3 paragraphs at the bottom</li>
            </ul>
