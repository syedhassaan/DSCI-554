# DSCI 554 Assignment 4

## Description

- Download [World Bank Open Data](http://data.worldbank.org) data of your choice for 20 countries so you can realize a bar, lollipop and bubble charts.
- Using Inkscape design a `minimalistic`:
  - Bar chart
  - Lollipop chart
  - Bubble chart
- In the `index.html` provided implement the table and the charts in separate script files __using d3 data join__:
  - Use d3 from `node_modules`
  - Describe your data and cite the sources
  - You can use lines for axes
  - You can place text manually with d3
  - You can format and load the data from different files
  - You want to create minimalistic charts with d3, but you do not need to match your minimalistic design
- Demonstrate good development practices by making at least 3 commits

## Rubric

__15% of the grade is for the lab.__

|               | Table  | Charts | Design | Development/Page |
| ------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---------------- |
| Sophisticated | Table is well formatted and well presented, supports well visual comparison, uses D3 data join, data is well formatted, imported as CSV (4-5 pts) | Chart is well formatted, uses D3 data join, data is well formatted, imported as CSV (4-5 pts *per chart*) | Minimalist charts are well designed. (4-5 pts *per chart*) | Using good development practices, the page is well formatted and includes all artifacts requested (4-5 pts) |
| Competent     | Table not well formatted, not well presented, support for visual comparison can be improved, improper use of D3 data join, data is not well formatted, not imported in CSV (2-3 pts) | Chart not well formatted, improper use of D3 data join, data not well formatted, not imported as CSV (2-3 pts *per chart*) | Minimalist charts are not well designed. (2-3 pts *per chart*) | Not using well good development practices, the page does not include all artifacts requested (2-3 pts) |
| Needs work    | Table is not formatted or not presented, do not support visual comparison, does not use D3 data join, data is not formatted, not imported as CSV (0-1 pts) | Chart is not formatted, does not use D3 data join, data is not formatted, not imported as CSV (0-1 pts *per chart*) | Minimalist charts are not designed or design is not appropriate. (0-1 pts *per chart*) | Not using good development practices, the page is not formatted or does not include all artifacts requested (0-1 pts) |

## Homework Guidelines

- Homework repository must be updated before the deadline
- Commits after the deadline will not be considered unless requested
- Late policy: 10% of total available points per each late day; duration less than 24 hours counts as one whole day
- Homework is expected to work in CHROME

## Important Note from Graders

__Ensure that you use the same case when referring to files than the actual filename__ as the homework may be assessed on Linux systems. For example, if an image tag refers to `myFile.png` but the actual filename is `myfile.png`, the image will not appear on the web page in Linux systems. We will deduct points if this happens. Use [Visual Studio Code HTML path completion feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_21#_html-path-completion) and/or double-check filenames to avoid this problem.
